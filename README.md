# AHA-IILAB

IIAB Interface Customization Proposal
Changes Made
Branding Elements:

Added AHAINNOVATE's logo (aha-logo_white_text_transparent) to the header

Changed color scheme to match Access Hub Africa's brand colors (orange and whites)

Updated typography to be more child-friendly with rounded, sans-serif fonts

Pupil-Friendly Adjustments:

Simplified the main navigation with larger, colorful buttons

Added visual icons for each content category

Increased font sizes for better readability

Organized content into clear categories (Learning, Books, Tools)

Footer Update:

Added "Powered by AHAINNOVATE Internet-in-a-Box" at the footer as requested

Included simple contact information

Design Rationale
For Pupil Users:

Simplicity: Children need clear, uncluttered interfaces with obvious navigation

Visual Cues: Icons and colors help non-readers and early readers navigate

Engagement: Bright but not overwhelming colors maintain focus

Accessibility: Larger touch targets work better on shared tablets

Brand Alignment:

Using the organization's colors and logo builds trust and recognition

Consistent branding helps teachers and administrators feel familiar with the system

Professional yet approachable design appeals to both children and educators

Technical Considerations
Maintained all existing functionality

Used responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility with low-end devices

Kept code changes minimal and well-commented for future maintenance

Optimized image assets for slow connections
